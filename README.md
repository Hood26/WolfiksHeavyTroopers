## README

**This is a reupload of an older mod that I really liked, so I rewrote an updated version of the mod that now works on SPT 4.0.x. that includes a few new additions that weren't originally in the mod. I DID NOT create the trooper masks, as they was created by SerWolfik.**

 **Original mod:** [**SerWolfik's Heavy Trooper**](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/212-wolfik-s-heavy-trooper/#overview)

## Mod Overview

Adds 5 new Heavy trooper masks: Coyote, Tan, Black, Wolf, and Cultist. These masks are like the original Tac-Kek trooper mask, but with higher armor tiers and much higher prices. These masks can be bought from Peacekeeper and the flea-market and are highly configurable (Check out the config file for more information!). Masks can also be found in-raid in weapon boxes, caches, duffle bags, and dead scavs. The ultra rare and valuable Cultist mask can be found worn by Cultists if you are lucky.

## Trooper Mask Information

Coyote Mask - Class 3 armor with max durability 45. Available at level 3 Peacekeeper for $1000 dollars.

Black And Tan Masks - Class 4 armor with max durability 50. Available at level 4 Peacekeeper for $1600 dollars.

Wolf Mask - Class 5 armor, with max durability 60. Available at level 4 Peacekeeper after completing quest "Wet Job - Part 5" for $3000 dollars

Cultist Mask - Class 5 armor, with max durability 80. Available at level 4 Peacekeeper after completing quest "The Guide" for $3500 dollars

## In-raid Mask Spawns

All Masks can also be found in-raid in loot containers: weapon boxes, caches, duffle bags, and dead scavs.

Cultist Trooper Masks can be found from Cultists if you are lucky,

## How To Install

Open the downloaded zip file then drag and drop the 'user' folder into your SPT directory

## Compatibility Issues:

These masks are not compatible with mods that add new nvgs or helmets as I have to manually make these mods compatible which I will try to do when such mods update to 4.0.x and above.
